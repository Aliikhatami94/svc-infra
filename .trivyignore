# Trivy ignore list (temporary, vendor images)
# Context: Upstream postgres:16-alpine on Alpine 3.22.2 currently ships libxml2 2.13.8-r0
# which triggers the following CRITICAL CVEs. Fixed in libxml2 2.13.9-r0.
# We only ignore these CVEs for vendor images until the tag updates propagate.
# Date added: 2025-10-18
# Review by: 2025-11-18 (remove once base images are patched)
